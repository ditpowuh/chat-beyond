# ChatBeyond

This web application serves to create a familiar environment and be an alternative to ChatGPT. It uses OpenAI's developer API, allowing layman/regular users to use OpenAI's stronger models without the need of paying a subscription.

> Note that this does NOT cover the cost of using the models.

Overview/Features:
- Able to use any of OpenAI's models
- Locally stored conversations and data
- Estimates cost by calculating the number of tokens and applying the model's pricing
- Made to be lightweight as possible
- UI built from the ground up

This app is recommended if you:
1. do not constantly use ChatGPT on a daily and a frequent basis
2. require a strong or stronger model from OpenAI

### Settings
The default model that is set is `gpt-4o`.

Note that you do not need to edit `settings.json` as all settings are configurable in the app itself.
